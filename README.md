🐾 **Paws & Preferences(assessment)**
**A tiny swipe-based app to discover your favourite cats**

Paws & Preferences is a small, fun web app I built for a pre-interview task.
The idea is simple: you swipe through a stack of cat photos (powered by the CATAAS API), just like you would on a dating app, and the app shows you the cats you liked at the end.

---

👉 **Swipe left or right**

Just like popular card-based interfaces:

- **Swipe right** if the cat melts your heart

- **Swipe left** if it’s not quite your type

Animations make the cards feel alive and smooth.

👉 **Works beautifully on mobile**

The whole interface is designed for thumbs:

- Gesture-based controls

- Fluid animations

- Responsive layout

- Easy to use with one hand

👉 **Helpful tutorial for first-time users**

When you first open the app, you’ll see a short, friendly onboarding overlay:

- Shows how swiping works

- Includes a playful ghost-card animation

- Disappears the moment you tap or start swiping

- Won’t show again (used localStorage)

👉 **A clear loading screen**

Because images come from the CATAAS API, I added a loading overlay so users know the app is still working:

- A soft dark backdrop

- A spinning loader

- “Finding cats…” text
This keeps the experience smooth, especially on slower networks or mobile devices.
